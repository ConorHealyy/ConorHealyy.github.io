title: OverTheWire Bandit Walkthrough (0-5)
---

### Introduction

I was poking around online recently and I was hoping to improve my Linux CLI skills, when I came across the wargame <strong><a href="url">bandit</a></strong> created by OverTheWire. 

The aim is the game is straightforward, at each level you will be looking for a new password which will allow you to log into the next level. For example when you complete the initial level you will then log in using the bandit1 credentials as opposed to bandit0.

Host : bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Username : bandit0
Password : bandit0 
Port : 2220
{% endhighlight %}

### Bandit Level 0

As posted at the top of this page we are provided with a username and password to connect to the provided host. This one is pretty simple, you just need to ssh into the machine. Please note you will also need to specify which port you will be using.


{% highlight js %}
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

Select Yes 

Password : bandit0

You are in! (Unless you messed up somewhere!)
